# ✅ FIX #10: Summarize the full blog into a structured brief BEFORE passing
# to campaign agents. Previously blog_post[:4000] was used, which for a
# 3000-word blog only covered ~600 words — roughly just the introduction.
# Campaign agents were writing LinkedIn posts, emails, and landing pages
# based entirely on the intro, missing all core arguments and the CTA.
