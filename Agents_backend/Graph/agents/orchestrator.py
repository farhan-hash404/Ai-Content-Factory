def _assign_evidence_to_tasks(plan: Plan, evidence: list) -> Plan:
    """
    Distributes evidence items across tasks so each worker receives a
    unique slice of the evidence pool instead of the full list.

    WHY THIS MATTERS:
    Previously every worker received all evidence and independently chose
    which facts to cite. With 9 sections and only 5 evidence items, every
    section naturally gravitated toward the same 2-3 most prominent stats
    (e.g. "70% of orgs use AI" and "GI Genius reduces missed polyps by 50%").
    Those two facts appeared 7+ times across a single blog post.

    DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY:
    - Opening sections (intro, context) get the first third of evidence —
      broad overview stats belong at the top.
    - Body sections share the middle evidence pool round-robin so adjacent
      sections pull from different sources.
    - Closing sections (practical, takeaways) get the final third — actionable
      data and forward-looking stats belong at the end.
    - Every task is guaranteed at least 1 evidence item.
    - If evidence is sparse (fewer items than tasks), items are shared but
      the assignment still prevents total overlap by rotating the starting
      index per task.

    The indices stored in task.assigned_evidence_indices reference positions
    in the global state["evidence"] list. fanout() in workers.py uses them
    to build the per-worker evidence payload.
